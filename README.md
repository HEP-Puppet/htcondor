##Overview
The htcondor modules allows you to set up a HTCondor cluster (https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/).
It depends on several other modules, including puppetlabs/(stdlib|concat|firewall).
Please check the metadata.json for detailed dependencies.

##Module Description
An HTCondor cluster consists of at least three types of nodes:
 * a worker for executing the jobs
 * a scheduler for job submission
 * a collector/negotiator to match jobs with workers

This puppet modules allows for the configuration of these three types of nodes.


##Setup
**What the htcondor module affects:**
 * configuration files and directories (/etc/condor/*)
 * installation of htcondor software (condor* packages)
 * a new fact for facter: condor_version

###Beginning with HTCondor
Since admins might wish to run their own repository or disable repositories after install,
the HTCondor repository is no longer included in the Puppet module since version 2.0.0.
Therefore, the first step is to install the latest HTCondor repository for your OS (https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/yum/):
```
yum install -y https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/yum/repo.d/htcondor-stable-rhel6.repo
```
If you wish to use a [pool password for authentication](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/latest/3_6Security.html#SECTION00463400000000000000) you will need to create one first: ```condor_store_cred -f <path_to_htcondor_module>/files/pool_password```.
